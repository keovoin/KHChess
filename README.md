# KHChess
KHChess is an open-source platform for exploring and benchmarking how large language models (LLMs) perform in chess. Rather than focusing on simple win/loss results, ChessArena.ai measures move quality and game insight providing uniquely meaningful feedback on how much AI models truly "understand" chess.
