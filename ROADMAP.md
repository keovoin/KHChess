## 🏆 Current State

### ✅ Currently Supported AI Models

These are the models users can select for human-vs-AI and AI-vs-AI games. The full source of
truth is [`api/services/ai/models.ts`](./api/services/ai/models.ts).

### ⚙️ Default AI-vs-AI Models

Used for live AI-vs-AI matches and as a backwards-compatible fallback for games without an
explicit model (`models` in `api/services/ai/models.ts`):

| Provider | Default model |
|----------|---------------|
| **OpenAI** | `o4-mini-2025-04-16` |
| **Google** | `gemini-2.5-flash` |
